# LibMngSys
Library Management System OLD

This is a Library Management System written in C++

(have lost the new improved version becuase i was storing those files on a usb.
Here are the old project files in my college servers)

This is still working perfectly but does not have the comfort features



You must at least have a c++ compiler that is version c++17 or above and have the makefile utilities installed

```
Get the compiler from here
https://gcc.gnu.org/

Get the makefile utilities from here 
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
```


**makefile is provided & can be run with 'make' command**


or else it can be compiled using

`g++ main.cpp Book.cpp Patron.cpp Loan.cpp PatronCollection.cpp LoanCollection.cpp AudioCD.cpp BookChild.cpp DVD.cpp LibraryItem.cpp LibraryItemCollection.cpp`

Run using

`./a.out for MacOS & Linux`

`./a.exe for windows`
